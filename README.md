# Advent of Code 2023 (in TypeScript)

I have decided to try to get a bit more experience with TypeScript via Advent of Code this year. I use TypeScript regularly at work, but the contrast between my familiarity with Ruby versus my familiarity with TypeScript is significant. Ruby feels like a "first language", in spoken language terms, and TypeScript is something I'm roughly conversational in but I sometimes get the tense wrong or have to talk very slowly. Haha.

I'm using the `ts-aoc-starter` repo, which you can get [here](https://github.com/nrwl/ts-aoc-starter).
